Step 1. Make sure you unlock steam via FireWatchUnlocker

Step 2. Install [Millennium](https://steambrew.app/):
open powershell and enter iwr -useb "https://steambrew.app/install.ps1" | iex 

Step 3. Download the Plugin
And then go where your steam.exe is (steam directory) then -> plugins folder -> new folder (call it whatever) then extract the zip contents in there. To find this plugins folder easily open steam go to top left steam button -> Millennium -> plugins -> browse local files.

Step 4. Enable it in Millennium plugin settings
Top left of steam "steam" button > Millennium -> plugins -> click fwuc -> save changes -> yes to restart

Then yeah just go to a game page and if you don't have it added already there will be an "add via fwuc button"
